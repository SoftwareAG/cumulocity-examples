PART F:  SOFTWARE AG LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PRE-DELIVERY OF SOFTWARE AG PRODUCTS 
ONLY

IMPORTANT:  THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES ONLY IF YOU ARE USING A PRE-DELIVERY VERSION 
OF SOFTWARE AG PRODUCTS. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ONLY APPLY AS LONG AND TO 
THE EXTENT AS YOU HAVE NOT EXECUTED A WRITTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT REGARDING 
THE SOFTWARE WITH A SOFTWARE AG SUBSIDIARY OR DISTRIBUTOR. MUTUAL EXECUTION OF A 
SUBSEQUENT WRITTEN COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT REGARDING THE SOFTWARE BY YOU AND 
A SOFTWARE AG SUBSIDIARY OR DISTRIBUTOR SHALL REPLACE THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT 
WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT.
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE IN ANY WAY INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR 
USING THE PRODUCT.

LICENCE GRANT
Licence Grant: Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, 
the Supplier grants to the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable right to use the Software based on the licence parameters set out 
in this Agreement and solely for the Term and subject to required emergency 
maintenance and force majeure events. The Customer may install and use the Software 
internally within its organization only.  
The Software may not be transferred, sold, assigned, sublicensed or otherwise conveyed 
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) to another party without Supplier's 
prior written consent. For Software which is licensed together as a bundle of 
separately listed software the relevant Software is intended only to be used as 
part of the relevant bundle and not separately on a stand-alone basis.

RESTRICTIONS
Restrictions: Except as expressly permitted in any related documentation, the 
Customer may not modify or adapt the Software in whole or in part (including 
but not limited to translating or creating derivative works) or reverse engineer, 
decompile or disassemble the Software (except to the extent applicable laws specifically 
prohibit such a restriction). The Customer may not use the Software for timesharing, 
rental or service bureau purposes and shall not remove any copyright notices or other 
proprietary notices from the Software. Results of benchmark or other performance tests 
run on the Software may not be disclosed to any third party without Supplier's prior 
written consent which consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the Supplier.

suppliers and is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. The 
Customer acquires only the non-exclusive right to use the Software as permitted herein 
and does not acquire any rights of ownership in the Software. The Customer agrees to 
protect Supplier's proprietary rights in the Software and will take all steps 
reasonably necessary to prevent the disclosure to any person other than its employees 
or to any other legal entity of proprietary information provided by Supplier.

TERMINATION
Termination: The Customer's licence to use the Software will automatically terminate 
as of the date set forth in this Agreement or, if not otherwise specified herein, 
thirty (30) days after the date that the Customer receives the Software from Supplier. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplier may immediately terminate the Agreement upon 
written notice to the Customer.  Upon any termination (howsoever arising) or expiry, 
the Customer shall cease using the Software and delete the Software from the 
Customer's system. If the Customer possesses the Software in any physical form, e.g. 
hard disk or otherwise, then the Customer shall, at the Customer's own expense, return 
the Software in its possession (including without limitation all related documentation) 
within ten (10) days of termination to Supplier. If requested by Supplier, the Customer 
shall send a letter certifying that the provisions of this clause have been adhered 
to. All disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability and provisions for the 
protection of Supplier's proprietary rights in the Software as set forth herein shall 
survive any termination of the Agreement.  

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
Warranty Disclaimer: The Customer acknowledges that the Software is provided 'as is' 
without anywarranty whatsoever solely for the Customer's evaluation.  THE SUPPLIER 
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT 
LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the extent permitted by law, Supplier shall not be liable for any damages caused 
by the use of the Software.

IPR INDEMNITY
Indemnity: Supplier shall indemnify, defend, and hold Customer harmless from any 
action brought by a third-party against Customer to the extent that it is caused by 
an allegation that the Software licensed under this Agreement has infringed an 
intellectual property right or trade secret registered in the country of Supplier�s 
residence, and pay those damages or costs related to the settlement of such action 
or finally awarded against Customer in such action, including but not limited to 
reasonable attorneys' fees, provided that Customer:
(a)     promptly notifies Supplier of any such action; and 
(b)     gives Supplier full authority, information, and assistance to defend such 
claim; and 
(c)     gives Supplier sole control of the defense of such claim and all 
negotiations for the compromise or settlement of such claim.

Exclusions: Supplier shall have no liability under this Agreement with respect to 
any claim based upon:
(a)     Software that has been modified by anyone other than Supplier; 
(b)     use of other than the then-current release of the Software, if the 
infringement could have been avoided by use of the then-current release and such 
current release has been made available to Customer; or
(c)     use of the Software in conjunction with Customer data where use with such 
data gave rise to the infringement claim.

Remedy by Supplier: If Supplier determines that the Software is or is likely to be 
the subject of a claim of infringement, Supplier shall have the right: 
(a)     to replace Customer's copy of the Software with non-infringing software 
that has substantially equivalent functionality; 
(b)     to modify the Software so as to cause the Software to be free of 
infringement; 
(c)     to terminate the licence to use the Software and Documentation.

Exclusive remedy: The provisions of this clause state the exclusive 
liability of the Supplier and the exclusive remedy of the Customer with 
respect to any claim of intellectual property infringement by the Software.

GENERAL

Data Protection: Unless stated otherwise, the obligations of the parties in 
connection with the processing of any customer data that qualify as 
personal data according to Art. 4 No. 1 of the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) ('Customer Personal Data') including the applicable 
technical and organizational measures that Supplier is required to implement 
and maintain to protect Customer Personal Data, shall be as set out in the 
Data Processing Agreement (if any) entered into between the Parties.

Third Party Licence Restrictions: The Software may contain or be distributed 
with certain open source, free or commercial third party licensor's 
components ('Third Party Components'). These Third Party Components, if any, 
may be identified in, and may be subject to, special licence terms and 
conditions ('Third Party Terms') set forth in '*.txt' or *.pdf' files in 
the installation directory, a licence notice on installation or in readme 
or licence files accompanying Third Party Components and may be retrieved 
online for then current versions of Software at http://softwareag.com/licenses. 
Third Party Terms include important licensing and warranty information and 
disclaimers of licensors.  For the avoidance of doubt the Third Party Terms 
do not restrict the rights granted under this Agreement.

Export Control: Customer may not download, get and/or provide access to, or 
otherwise export or re-export any underlying software or service, technology 
or other information from the Software or Documentation except as stated 
explicitly in this Agreement and in full compliance with all applicable 
national and international laws and regulations. Customer agrees to indemnify 
and hold harmless and defend Supplier against any and all liability arising 
from or relating to Customer's breach of this Clause. Supplier reserves the 
right not to execute affected parts of, or the entire Agreement, in case any 
national or international export regulations or foreign trade legislation, or 
any target country/customer/usage restrictions implied by embargoes or other 
sanctions prohibit the provision of export controlled goods (Dual'Use items) 
and services to be granted to the Customer under this Agreement. Supplier will 
inform the Customer whether a related official export approval by national or 
international export control authorities is required. Provision of affected 
goods and services will then be postponed until all such required approvals 
have been granted. The provision of agreed goods or services not restricted 
by the above mentioned export prohibitions will remain unaffected by this 
clause.

Governing Law: This Agreement and all matters relating to the interpretation 
and effect of this Agreement are made and will be governed exclusively by 
and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany without giving effect 
to its conflicts-of-laws provisions and exclusion of the United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The 
parties consent and submit to exclusive personal jurisdiction, procedure 
and venue for legal disputes arising from or connected with this Agreement 
shall lie with the courts of Darmstadt, Germany. Arbitration processes are 
excluded.
